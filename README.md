RLATools (Record Linkage Algorithm Tools)
=========================================

This record linkage tool is based on single linkage hierarchical clustering. You may read the paper titled [Efficient sequential and parallel algorithms for record linkage](http://jamia.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/252.full).

To run the desktop tool we need a configuration file where input data files are configured. Here we have put a sample 
configuration file. We encourage you to use [web tool](http://rlatools.com). But if you feel free to use .xml file, 
you may use this.

To run the application from command line:
java -jar path/RLT_S.jar path/config_file_name.xml
